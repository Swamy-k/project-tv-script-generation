# project-tv-script-generation
## Project Overview
In this project, I generated own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I used part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I builded will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
## Libraries
- PyTorch is the main libraries used for this project.
